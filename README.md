# Leet Hints: A Description

Leet Hints is a collection of coding problems that I've solved along with descriptions/hints of approaches to solve the problem. A user can create an account, view existing challenges and hints, or add their own. A user can also comment on challenges posted by other users. The goal of my app is two-fold: connect developers as they build their skills and as a way of displaying my growing knowledge of algorithms and data structures to others in the field.
